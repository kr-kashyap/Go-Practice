-> Capacity of slice while appending

While appending the capacity of new map is calculated by incrementing the value of the current cap by 1 and it is doubled.

For eg. cap=12
Check if (12+1)*2 works or not. If not (13+1)*2.


-> "->"" and "." operator in Go
	
	In Go, both "->"" and "." are represented by "."

	The compiler knows the types, and can dereference if necessary.

-> For LinkedList 
	
	Check for nil.

-> Literals

	arr1 := []int{}
	
	//Error
	//arr := []struct{}
	arr := []struct{}{}

	type Vertex struct {
		Lat, Long float64
	}
	arr := []Vertex{}
