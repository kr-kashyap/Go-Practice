A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. 

	func main() {
		defer fmt.Println("world")

		fmt.Println("hello")
	}

Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order. 

	func main() {
		fmt.Println("counting")

		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			defer fmt.Println(i)
		}

		fmt.Println("done")
	}

	/* 
		O/P

		counting
		done
		9
		8
		7
		6
		5
		4
		3
		2
		1
		0
